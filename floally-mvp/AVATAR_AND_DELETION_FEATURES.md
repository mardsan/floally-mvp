# Avatar Selection and Profile Deletion Features

**Date:** January 2025  
**Commit:** c5fec08  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed

## Overview

Added comprehensive avatar management and account deletion features to the profile settings system, completing the core user profile management experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Avatar Selection Component (`AvatarSelector.jsx`)

**Two-Tab Interface:**
- **Default Avatars Tab:** 12 curated avatars from DiceBear API
  - Felix (avataaars style)
  - Annie (avataaars style) 
  - Luna (lorelei style)
  - Max (bottts style)
  - Sophie (personas style)
  - Charlie (fun-emoji style)
  - And 6 more unique avatars
  
- **Upload Custom Tab:** File upload with validation
  - Accepts: JPG, PNG, GIF image formats
  - Max size: 5MB
  - Real-time preview
  - Converts to base64 for storage
  - Upload guidelines with best practices

**User Experience:**
- Grid display with selection highlighting
- Click to select any avatar
- Immediate visual feedback
- "Save Avatar" button to confirm
- Clean, modern UI with proper spacing

### 2. Profile Deletion Modal (`DeleteProfileModal.jsx`)

**Three-Step Safety Process:**

**Step 1: Warning & Alternatives**
- Clear list of what will be deleted:
  - Profile information and settings
  - Connected accounts (Google, etc.)
  - Email management preferences
  - All personalized data
  - Billing subscriptions (auto-canceled)
- Alternative options presented:
  - Pause subscription temporarily
  - Downgrade to free tier
  - Contact support for help
  - Just disconnect apps without deleting

**Step 2: Feedback Collection**
- Dropdown with 8 deletion reasons:
  - Not using it enough
  - Too expensive
  - Missing features I need
  - Found a better alternative
  - Privacy concerns
  - Technical issues
  - Just trying it out
  - Other
- Optional details text area
- "Would you recommend?" Yes/No buttons

**Step 3: Final Confirmation**
- Must type exactly: "DELETE MY ACCOUNT"
- Displays collected feedback for review
- Button disabled until text matches
- "Permanently Delete Account" action

**Safety Features:**
- Cannot proceed without selecting reason
- Requires exact text match to confirm
- Shows feedback summary before final action
- Clear warnings at each step
- Back button available (except final step)
- Cancel button always visible

### 3. Backend Integration

**New API Endpoints:**

```
DELETE /api/user/profile
- Deletes user and all associated data via cascade
- Returns success confirmation
```

```
POST /api/user/delete-feedback
- Logs deletion feedback for analysis
- Stores: reason, details, recommendation, user email
- Helps improve product based on why users leave
```

**Database Cascade Deletion:**
When a user is deleted, SQLAlchemy automatically removes:
- UserProfile record
- All ConnectedAccount records
- All BehaviorAction records
- All UserSettings records
- All SenderStats records

### 4. Profile Settings Integration

**Updated `ProfileSettings.jsx`:**
- Camera icon on avatar now clickable → opens AvatarSelector
- New "Danger Zone" section in Profile tab
  - Warning styling (red border, cautionary text)
  - "Delete Account" button
  - Positioned at bottom of Profile tab
  
**Avatar Selection Flow:**
1. User clicks camera icon
2. AvatarSelector modal opens
3. User selects default or uploads custom
4. Clicks "Save Avatar"
5. Avatar saved to backend via PUT /api/user/profile
6. localStorage updated immediately
7. Profile UI updates without page refresh
8. Modal closes

**Deletion Flow:**
1. User clicks "Delete Account" in Danger Zone
2. DeleteProfileModal opens (Step 1: Warning)
3. User reviews what gets deleted and alternatives
4. Clicks "Continue to Delete" → Step 2: Feedback
5. Selects reason and optionally adds details
6. Clicks "Next" → Step 3: Final Confirmation
7. Types "DELETE MY ACCOUNT" exactly
8. Clicks "Permanently Delete Account"
9. Feedback sent to backend
10. Account deleted via API
11. localStorage cleared
12. Redirect to landing page

## Technical Details

**Avatar Storage:**
- Default avatars: DiceBear API URLs (lightweight)
- Custom avatars: Base64 encoded strings
- Stored in `users.avatar_url` column
- Also cached in localStorage for quick access

**File Upload Validation:**
```javascript
// Image type check
if (!file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
  alert('Please upload an image file');
  return;
}

// Size limit (5MB)
if (file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
  alert('Image must be smaller than 5MB');
  return;
}
```

**Feedback Logging:**
Currently logs to console for analysis. Future enhancement: store in dedicated `account_deletion_feedback` table for product insights.

## User Interface

**AvatarSelector Modal:**
- Full-screen overlay with centered modal
- Two tabs with clean switching
- 3-column grid for default avatars
- File upload area with drag-drop feel
- Guidelines section with icon bullets
- Save/Cancel buttons in footer

**DeleteProfileModal:**
- Progressive disclosure (3 steps)
- Red accent colors for danger zone
- Yellow warning boxes
- Alternative options in grid layout
- Feedback form with proper spacing
- Clear step indicators
- Responsive design for mobile

## Security Considerations

**Avatar Upload:**

- Consider adding server-side validation
- Base64 storage increases database size
- Consider moving to cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary) for production

**Account Deletion:**
- User must be authenticated to delete
- No recovery after deletion (permanent)
- All data cascade deleted via foreign keys
- Feedback collected before deletion (can't retrieve after)
- Consider adding "soft delete" option with 30-day grace period

## Future Enhancements

1. **Avatar Features:**
   - Webcam photo capture
   - Avatar cropping/editing tool
   - AI-generated avatar options
   - Sync with Google profile photo
   - Avatar history/previous avatars

2. **Deletion Features:**
   - Data export before deletion (GDPR compliance)
   - 30-day grace period (soft delete)
   - Account recovery option
   - Export deletion feedback to analytics
   - Email confirmation requirement
   - Schedule deletion for future date

3. **Feedback Analysis:**
   - Create `deletion_feedback` table
   - Dashboard for analyzing churn reasons
   - Automated retention emails based on reason
   - A/B test different retention strategies

## Deployment

**Frontend:** Deployed to Vercel (www.okaimy.com)
**Backend:** Deployed to Railway (floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app)

**Environment Variables Needed:**
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend URL for API calls

**Database Changes:**
- No migrations needed (using existing columns)
- `users.avatar_url` - stores avatar (existing)
