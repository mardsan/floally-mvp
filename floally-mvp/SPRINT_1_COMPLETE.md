# Sprint 1 Complete - v1.2.0: Adaptive AI Foundation ðŸš€

**Released:** January 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing & Deployment

## Overview

Sprint 1 transforms OpAime from a reactive AI assistant into an **adaptive AI chief of staff** that learns user preferences and personalizes interactions. This release builds the foundation for behavioral pattern learning, smart automation, and evolving intelligence.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **User Onboarding Flow** 
*"Interview with Your Partner"*

- **5-Step Conversational Wizard:**
  1. **Role** - User's job title/role
  2. **Priorities** - Top 3 focus areas (Client work, Team collaboration, Creative focus, etc.)
  3. **Decision Style** - How they like to receive information (Options with context, Just recommend, Ask questions, Show data)
  4. **Communication Style** - Tone preference (Concise & direct, Warm & friendly, Formal, Casual)
  5. **Newsletter Management** - Unsubscribe preference (Ask first, Auto-suggest 30 days, Archive, Manual)

- **UX Design:**
  - Modal overlay with progress indicator
  - Back/Next navigation with validation
  - Emoji icons for visual engagement
  - OpAime brand gradient styling (#dafef4 mint green)
  - Triggers automatically on first login
  - Can be re-done via Settings

### 2. **User Profile System** (Backend)

**New API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/user/profile?user_email={email}` - Get user profile (or defaults)
- `POST /api/user/profile/onboarding?user_email={email}` - Save onboarding answers
- `PUT /api/user/profile?user_email={email}` - Update specific fields
- `GET /api/user/profile/insights?user_email={email}` - Natural language summary of Aime's understanding

**Profile Data Model:**
```python
{
  "user_id": str,
  "role": str,
  "priorities": List[str],  # e.g., ["Client work", "Team collaboration"]
  "decision_style": str,     # options_with_context | just_recommend | ask_questions | show_data
  "communication_style": str, # concise_direct | warm_friendly | formal_professional | casual_conversational
  "unsubscribe_preference": str, # ask_before | auto_suggest_30days | just_archive | manual
  "work_hours": dict,
  "onboarding_completed": bool
}
```

**Storage:** File-based JSON (`user_profiles/{email}.json`) - Easy migration to database later

**Insights Feature:** Converts structured profile to natural language:
> "You're a creative director who values client work, team collaboration. You like warm, friendly interactions. When making decisions, you like to see options with detailed context."

### 3. **Enhanced Gmail Categorization**

**New Email Fields (beyond existing spam/promo/social/updates/important/starred):**

- **`isPrimary`**: Detects Primary category (INBOX without CATEGORY_ labels)
- **`isForums`**: Detects Forums category (CATEGORY_FORUMS label)
- **`isNewsletter`**: Smart detection (has unsubscribe link + promotional/updates category)
- **`hasUnsubscribeLink`**: Checks List-Unsubscribe headers
- **`domain`**: Extracts sender domain (e.g., "example.com" from "hello@example.com")

**Purpose:** Foundation for pattern learning - track which senders user engages with, identify unsubscribe candidates, detect newsletter overload.

### 4. **Settings Page Component**

**Sections:**
- **Aime's Understanding** - Natural language insights showing how Aime sees the user
- **Your Profile** - Display of role, priorities, decision style, communication style, newsletter preference
- **Edit Profile** - Button to re-do onboarding
- **Data & Privacy** - Transparency about data storage

**Features:**
- Matches OpAime brand design
- Editable fields
- "Delete All Data" option for privacy

### 5. **Profile-Enhanced AI Prompts**

**Daily Stand-Up Enhancement:**
- AI Stand-Up now includes user profile context in Claude prompt
- Prioritizes "The One Thing" based on user's top priorities
- Matches communication tone to user preference (warm/friendly vs concise/direct)
- Makes recommendations aligned with user's decision style

**Example Context Injection:**
```
User Profile:
- Role: Creative Director
- Top Priorities: Client work, Team collaboration
- Communication Preference: warm and friendly
```

**Result:** Personalized stand-ups that feel tailored to the individual's working style.

### 6. **Frontend Integration**

**App.jsx Updates:**
- Auto-loads user profile on login
- Triggers onboarding if `onboarding_completed === false`
- Settings button in header (only visible after onboarding)
- Profile context passed to AI stand-up generation
- Modal system for onboarding and settings

**User Flow:**
1. User logs in for first time
2. Onboarding modal appears automatically
3. User answers 5 questions (~2 minutes)
4. Profile saved, onboarding dismissed
5. Settings button appears in header
6. Daily stand-ups now personalized
7. Can edit profile anytime via Settings

git push origin main

# 5. Monitor deployment
# Railway: https://railway.app (backend auto-deploys)
# Vercel: https://vercel.com (frontend auto-deploys)
```

## What's Next: Sprint 2 (Behavioral Learning)

### Planned Features:
1. **Behavior Tracking System**
   - Track email opens, replies, archives
   - Measure engagement with different senders
   - Build sender importance scores

2. **Smart Rules Engine**
   - Auto-archive based on patterns
   - Auto-star important senders
   - Batch newsletters for digest

3. **Unsubscribe Helper**
   - Suggest unsubscribes for newsletters not opened in 30 days
   - One-click unsubscribe suggestions
   - Unsubscribe tracking and confirmation

4. **Proactive Insights**
   - "Aime's Recommendations" dashboard section
   - Pattern-based suggestions
   - Anomaly detection (unusual email volume, important sender ignored)

### Architecture Evolution:
- Migrate from file-based storage to PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- Add behavioral events table
- Implement rules engine with pattern matching
- Build sender scoring algorithm

## Success Metrics

**User Adoption:**
- % of users completing onboarding
- Average time to complete onboarding
- Settings page engagement

**AI Personalization:**
- Stand-up tone matches communication preference
- "The One Thing" aligns with user priorities
- User satisfaction with AI responses

**Pattern Learning Foundation:**
- Newsletter detection accuracy
- Unsubscribe link detection accuracy
- Domain extraction success rate

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

1. **Storage:** File-based (MVP) - migrate to database in Sprint 2
2. **Newsletter UI:** Badges not yet displayed in email list - add in Sprint 2
3. **Unsubscribe Action:** Detection only - no unsubscribe execution yet
4. **Multi-user:** Profile isolation works, but no admin/team features
5. **Mobile:** Responsive but not optimized for mobile onboarding flow

## Architecture Notes

### Why File-Based Storage?
- Fast MVP implementation (no database setup)
- Easy debugging (human-readable JSON)
- Simple migration path to PostgreSQL later
- One file per user = natural isolation
- Git-friendly for early development

### Profile as Foundation for Learning:
This sprint establishes the **baseline understanding** of each user. Future sprints will build on this with:
- Behavioral data (what user actually does)
- Pattern recognition (what Aime observes)
- Adaptive adjustments (Aime evolves understanding)

The onboarding creates the "initial interview" - future behavioral tracking creates the "ongoing conversation."
