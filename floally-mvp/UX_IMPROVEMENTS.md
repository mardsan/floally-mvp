# OpAime UX Improvements - October 14, 2025

## Summary of Changes

### 1. AI Stand-Up Moved to Top ✨
**Rationale:** This is the primary value proposition - users should see it first thing each day.

**Changes:**
- Moved AI Stand-Up section from bottom to top of dashboard
- Now the first interactive element users see after login
- Positioned above email and calendar for maximum visibility

### 2. Expandable Email Reading 📧
**Problem:** Users couldn't read full emails or take action without leaving the app.

**Solution:**
- Click any email to expand and see full preview
- Added "Open in Gmail" button for each email (opens specific email thread)
- Added "Mark as Read" button placeholder (UI ready for future backend integration)
- Shows up to 8 recent messages (increased from 5)
- Visual indicator (▶ / ▼) shows expand/collapse state
- Added "Open Gmail" link in header for quick access to full inbox

**UX Details:**
- Smooth expand/collapse animation
- Full email snippet shown in expanded state with scrollable area
- Background color differentiates collapsed vs expanded states
- Avatar circles with sender initial for quick visual scanning

### 3. Calendar Date Labels 📅
**Problem:** All events showed "Today" but many were for future dates.

**Solution:**
- Implemented smart date formatting:
  - "Today" for events happening today
  - "Tomorrow" for next-day events
  - "Thu, Oct 17" format for events beyond tomorrow
- Date/time display in left column for quick scanning
- Shows full time range (9:00 AM - 10:00 AM)
- Added "Open Calendar" link in header

**Visual Improvements:**
- Date badge with white background stands out
- Large time display for at-a-glance checking
- Duration and attendee count on same line
- Location shown with 📍 emoji when available

### 4. Quick Access Links 🔗
Added direct links to:
- Gmail (top-right of Messages card)
- Google Calendar (top-right of Calendar card)
- Individual email threads (in expanded email view)

All links open in new tabs to preserve OpAime dashboard state.

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```javascript
const [expandedEmail, setExpandedEmail] = useState(null);
const [expandedEvent, setExpandedEvent] = useState(null); // Reserved for future use
```

### New Helper Function
```javascript
const formatEventDate = (dateString) => {
  // Smart date formatting: Today, Tomorrow, or "Day, Mon DD"
  // Handles timezone-aware date comparison
}
```

### Layout Changes
- AI Stand-Up: Full-width card at top with gradient background
- Email/Calendar: Side-by-side grid below (unchanged grid structure)
- Version bumped to 1.0.2
