# Sprint 2 Phase 1: Intelligent Email Actions & Behavioral Learning ✅

**Status:** 🎉 COMPLETE  
**Version:** 1.3.0  
**Completed:** January 2025

## What We Built

### 1. **Email Action Buttons** 
Quick actions for every important email:

- **⭐ Focus** - Mark as Important & Star (signals high priority)
- **❌ Not Interested** - Mark as unimportant (negative learning signal)
- **📧 Respond** - Generate AI draft response
- **📥 Archive** - Remove from inbox (keep searchable)
- **🚫 Unsubscribe** - Extract and open unsubscribe link (for newsletters)
- **🗑️ Trash** - Move to trash (destructive, requires confirmation)

**UI Features:**
- Loading states on all buttons
- Disabled state while processing
- Confirmation modal for unsubscribe
- Auto-archive after unsubscribing
- Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)

### 2. **Behavioral Learning Backend**
Tracks every user action for pattern learning:

**New Router:** `/api/behavior`

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/behavior/log-action` - Log user action on email
- `GET /api/behavior/sender-stats?user_email={email}` - Get sender statistics
- `GET /api/behavior/behavior-log?user_email={email}&limit={limit}` - Get action history
- `GET /api/behavior/insights?user_email={email}` - Generate behavioral insights

**Data Tracked:**
```python
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00",
  "email_id": "abc123",
  "sender_email": "newsletter@example.com",
  "sender_domain": "example.com",
  "action_type": "archive",  # important, unimportant, archive, trash, respond, unsubscribe
  "email_category": "newsletter",
  "has_unsubscribe": true,
  "confidence_score": 0.85
}
```

**Sender Statistics Calculation:**
- **Importance Score:** `(important × 2 + responded × 1.5) / total_actions`
- Normalized to 0-1 range
- Higher score = you engage more with this sender
- Used for future predictions

### 3. **Gmail Action Endpoints**
Direct Gmail API integration:

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/gmail/mark-important?email_id={id}` - Add IMPORTANT + STARRED labels
- `POST /api/gmail/mark-unimportant?email_id={id}` - Remove IMPORTANT label
- `POST /api/gmail/archive?email_id={id}` - Remove INBOX label
- `POST /api/gmail/trash?email_id={id}` - Move to trash
- `GET /api/gmail/unsubscribe-link?email_id={id}` - Extract unsubscribe URL from headers

**Gmail API Features Used:**
- `users().messages().modify()` - Add/remove labels
- `users().messages().trash()` - Move to trash
- Header parsing - Extract List-Unsubscribe URLs
- Label management - IMPORTANT, STARRED, INBOX

### 4. **Storage System**
File-based behavioral data (MVP approach):

**Files Created:**
- `behavior_data/{email}_behavior.json` - Action log (last 1000 actions)
- `behavior_data/{email}_sender_stats.json` - Sender importance scores

**Why File-Based:**
- Fast prototyping
- Easy debugging (human-readable JSON)
- No database setup needed
- Simple migration path to PostgreSQL later

**Data Retention:**
- Behavior log: Last 1000 actions per user
- Sender stats: All-time cumulative
- Automatically rotates to prevent bloat

### 5. **Frontend Integration**

**New Component:** `EmailActions.jsx`
- Reusable action button toolbar
- Handles all Gmail API calls
- Logs behavioral data automatically
- Manages loading/error states
- Shows unsubscribe confirmation modal

**App.jsx Updates:**
- Imported EmailActions component
- Added `handleEmailAction` callback
- Optimistic UI updates (removes archived/trashed emails instantly)
- Success feedback via console (ready for toast notifications)

**API Service Updates:**
- Added `gmail.markImportant(emailId)`
- Added `gmail.markUnimportant(emailId)`
- Added `gmail.archive(emailId)`
- Added `gmail.trash(emailId)`
- Added `gmail.getUnsubscribeLink(emailId)`
- Added complete `behavior` service with 4 functions

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created:
1. `backend/app/routers/behavior.py` (267 lines) - Behavioral tracking system
2. `frontend/src/components/EmailActions.jsx` (194 lines) - Action button UI

### Files Modified:
1. `backend/app/routers/gmail.py` - Added 5 action endpoints (+120 lines)
2. `backend/app/main.py` - Registered behavior router
3. `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added gmail actions + behavior API (+20 lines)
4. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Integrated EmailActions component (+50 lines)

### Total Code Added:
- Backend: ~390 lines
- Frontend: ~264 lines
- **Total: ~654 lines**

## User Flow

### Before (v1.2.0):
1. User logs in
2. Aime analyzes emails
3. User sees which are important
4. **User manually goes to Gmail to take action** ❌

### After (v1.3.0):
1. User logs in
2. Aime analyzes emails  
3. User sees which are important
4. **User clicks action buttons directly in OpAime** ✅
5. **Aime learns from every action** 🧠
6. **Future: Aime predicts actions before you take them** 🚀

## Behavioral Learning

### What Aime Learns:
- **Sender Importance:** Which senders you mark as important vs archive
- **Response Patterns:** Who you respond to vs ignore
- **Newsletter Engagement:** Which newsletters you read vs unsubscribe from
- **Category Preferences:** How you treat promotional vs primary emails

### How It Works:
```
User clicks ⭐ Focus on email from alice@company.com
  ↓
EmailActions logs action to backend
  ↓
Behavior API saves: {action: "important", sender: "alice@company.com", ...}
  ↓
Sender stats updated: alice@company.com importance_score += 0.2
  ↓
Next time email from alice@company.com arrives:
  → Aime checks sender stats
  → Sees high importance score
  → Predicts you'll want to mark as important
  → (Future feature) Pre-suggests: "Mark as important? You usually do with emails from Alice."
```

### Importance Score Algorithm:
```python
# Give more weight to positive actions
score = (marked_important × 2 + responded × 1.5) / total_actions
# Normalize to 0-1
importance_score = min(1.0, score / 2.0)
```

**Examples:**
- 10 emails from sender, marked important 8 times: **Score = 0.8** (high importance)
- 10 emails from sender, archived 9 times: **Score = 0.05** (low importance)
- 10 emails from sender, responded to 5 times: **Score = 0.375** (moderate importance)

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests:
- [ ] POST /api/gmail/mark-important adds labels correctly
- [ ] POST /api/gmail/archive removes INBOX label
- [ ] POST /api/gmail/trash moves email to trash
- [ ] GET /api/gmail/unsubscribe-link extracts URL from headers
- [ ] POST /api/behavior/log-action saves to file
- [ ] GET /api/behavior/sender-stats calculates importance scores
- [ ] Behavior log rotates at 1000 entries

### Frontend Tests:
- [ ] EmailActions buttons render for each important email
- [ ] Click ⭐ Focus marks email as important (check Gmail)
- [ ] Click 📥 Archive removes from inbox
- [ ] Click 🚫 Unsubscribe opens modal with link
- [ ] Unsubscribe modal opens link in new tab
- [ ] After action, email removed from view (archive/trash)

## What's Next: Phase 2

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Migrate to Database** (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
   - Create `behavior_events` table
   - Create `sender_stats` table
   - Migration script from JSON files
   - Indexed queries for performance

2. **Predictive Suggestions**
   - Analyze behavior patterns
   - Generate confidence scores
   - Add "Predicted Action" badges to emails
   - Show "Why?" tooltips with reasoning

3. **Bulk Approval Mode**
   - Group suggested actions
   - "Archive (12 emails)" section
   - "Mark Important (3 emails)" section
   - One-click approve all
   - Queue system for batch processing

4. **Enhanced Insights Dashboard**
   - "Aime's Learning" section in Settings
   - Top senders by importance
   - Action breakdown chart
   - Newsletter engagement stats
   - Unsubscribe suggestions

### Future Sprint Features:
- **Smart Rules:** "Always archive emails from {sender}"
- **Auto-Actions:** High confidence (>90%) actions execute automatically
- **Digest Mode:** Batch newsletters for weekly summary
- **Response Patterns:** Aime drafts responses matching your past style
- **Anomaly Detection:** "You usually respond to Jane within 1 hour - this is overdue"

## Privacy & Control

**User Data:**
- All behavioral data is user-scoped (isolated by email)
- Stored locally in file system (easy to delete)
- No cross-user data sharing
- Transparent action logging

**Future Controls (Settings page):**
- View all logged actions
- Delete behavioral data
- Disable learning toggle
- Export data as JSON
- See sender importance scores

## Success Metrics

**Adoption:**
- % of users who click action buttons
- Actions per session
- Most used action (important vs archive vs unsubscribe)

**Learning:**
- Behavioral events logged per user
- Sender stats calculated
- Time to 100 actions (enough for patterns)

**Efficiency:**
- Time saved vs manual Gmail
- Actions completed in OpAime vs Gmail
- User satisfaction with quick actions

## Known Limitations

1. **No Undo:** Actions are immediate (Gmail API doesn't support atomic rollback)
   - Mitigation: Trash can be undone in Gmail, Archive is non-destructive
   
2. **File-Based Storage:** Won't scale past ~1000 users
   - Mitigation: Planned migration to PostgreSQL in Phase 2
   
3. **No Batch Actions Yet:** Can't select multiple emails at once
   - Mitigation: Planned for Phase 3 (bulk approval mode)
   
4. **Unsubscribe Opens External Link:** Can't unsubscribe in-app
   - Mitigation: Gmail API doesn't support programmatic unsubscribe, must use List-Unsubscribe header

5. **No Real-Time Sync:** Email list doesn't auto-refresh after actions
   - Mitigation: Optimistic UI updates (removes from view), full refresh on page reload

## Architecture Notes

### Why This Approach?

**File-Based Storage:**
- MVP speed (no DB setup)
- Easy to debug and inspect
- Natural user isolation (one file per user)
- Simple migration to DB (just change read/write functions)

**Behavioral Learning Foundation:**
- Starts simple (just log actions)
- Builds data over time
- Ready for ML/AI when we have enough data
- Can experiment with algorithms without schema changes

**Gmail API Integration:**
- Direct API calls (no third-party dependencies)
- Uses native Gmail labels (portable)
- Respects Gmail's architecture (INBOX is a label)
- Works with user's existing Gmail organization

### Learning Algorithm Evolution:

**Phase 1 (Current):** Simple importance scoring
```python
score = (important × 2 + responded × 1.5) / total_actions
```

**Phase 2 (Next):** Time-weighted scoring
```python
# More recent actions weighted higher
score = Σ(action_weight × time_decay) / total_actions
```

**Phase 3 (Future):** ML-based predictions
```python
# Train model on:
# - Sender history
# - Email content/subject patterns
# - Time of day patterns
# - Category correlations
prediction = model.predict(email_features)
```
