## 🎯 Your Action Items (30-60 minutes)

### 1. Configure Custom Domain (OkAimy.com)

**On Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to https://vercel.com/mardsan/floally-mvp-frontend
2. Click **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Click **Add Domain**
4. Enter: `okaimy.com` and `www.okaimy.com`
5. Vercel will give you DNS records to add

**On Your Domain Registrar (GoDaddy/Namecheap/etc.):**

1. Log in to your domain registrar
2. Find DNS settings for `okaimy.com`
3. Add the records Vercel provided:
   - **A Record:** Point `@` to Vercel's IP (e.g., `76.76.21.21`)
   - **CNAME Record:** Point `www` to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. Save changes (DNS propagation takes 5-60 minutes)

**Test:**
- Visit http://okaimy.com (should redirect to HTTPS)
- Visit http://www.okaimy.com (should also work)
- Both should show the landing page

**Get Measurement ID:**

1. After creation, you'll see a **Measurement ID** (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
2. Copy this ID

**Add to Vercel Environment Variables:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add new variable:
   - **Name:** `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
   - **Value:** Your `G-XXXXXXXXXX` ID
   - **Environment:** Production, Preview, Development (select all)
3. Click **Save**
4. Redeploy your app (Settings → Deployments → ... → Redeploy)

**Add Google Tag to Landing Page:**

Add this to `/frontend/index.html` in the `<head>` section:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID.

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Landing Page Optimization:**
- Change headline every 3-4 days, track which converts better
- Add testimonials as you get them from demos
- Update "X on waitlist" number weekly (creates FOMO)
- Add demo booking calendar link (Calendly) after 20+ signups

**Email Nurture Sequence (Set up in EmailOctopus/ConvertKit):**
1. **Day 0 (Immediate):** Welcome! You're on the list.
2. **Day 3:** Here's what Aimy does differently (education)
3. **Day 7:** Want to see a demo? (calendar link)
4. **Day 14:** We're getting close to launch! (urgency)

**Ad Campaign Tips:**
- Start with small budget ($20/day) to test
- Run 2-3 ad variations simultaneously
- Check cost per lead daily - pause if >$15
- Successful ads: Scale budget to $50-100/day
- Failed ads: Turn off, try new creative

**Conversion Boosters:**
- Add "As seen in..." if you get any press
- Add "Trusted by X professionals" (update number)
- Show screenshots of the actual product
- Add FAQ section if same questions appear
- Offer "Book a demo" option for serious prospects

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Domain not working after 1 hour":**
- DNS can take up to 48 hours, but usually 5-60 minutes
- Clear browser cache and try incognito mode
- Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org

**"Waitlist form not submitting":**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify backend is running: https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/health
- Check CORS settings in backend

**"Google Analytics not tracking":**
- Verify Measurement ID is correct
- Check if ad blockers are enabled (they block GA)
- Use GA Debugger Chrome extension
- Wait 24 hours for data to appear (realtime should be instant)

**"Cost per signup too high (>$15)":**
- Narrow audience targeting (too broad)
- Test different ad creative
- Improve landing page headline
- Add social proof / testimonials

**"High traffic, low conversions (<5%)":**
- Headline doesn't match ad promise
- Form too long (remove fields)
- Add trust signals (testimonials, guarantees)
- Test different CTAs
