## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Aimy Wizard Date Generation

### What Changed
- **Before**: Goals had relative deadlines like "Week 1", "End of month", "2 weeks"
- **After**: Goals have actual calendar dates like "2025-11-08", "2025-11-15"

### Technical Details
**File**: `backend/app/routers/ai.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `from datetime import datetime` import
- Updated Claude prompt to include today's date: `TODAY'S DATE: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}`
- Modified prompt instructions:
  ```
  IMPORTANT for deadlines:
  - Use ACTUAL dates in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-11-01", "2025-11-15")
  - Calculate dates from today: {current_date}
  - Space goals realistically (1-2 weeks apart for most tasks)
  ```

**Impact**:
- Goals are now actionable - can be added to external calendars
- Integrates with Universal Calendar for timeline visualization
- Enables better daily recommendations from Aimy
