# Quick Fix Guide - Gmail Authentication

## ⚡ Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Authenticate via Railway Backend

**Click this link**:
👉 **https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login**

This will:
1. Redirect you to Google OAuth consent screen
2. Ask for permissions (Gmail, Calendar, etc.)
3. Store your credentials in PostgreSQL
4. Redirect you back to www.okaimy.com

### Step 2: Grant Permissions

When Google asks, make sure to:
- ✅ Allow access to Gmail
- ✅ Allow access to Calendar
- ✅ Click "Continue" / "Allow"

### Step 3: Verify It Works

After redirecting back to www.okaimy.com:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for standup logs
3. You should see:
   ```
   🔍 Starting standup analysis for user: your-email@gmail.com
   📧 Getting Gmail service...
   ✅ Gmail service obtained successfully
   📨 Fetching emails with query: in:inbox after:2025/10/27
   ✅ Email list fetched: X messages
   ```

### Expected Result

The standup should now show:
- ✅ `secondary_priorities`: Array with actual email-based priorities
- ✅ `aimy_handling`: Array with tasks Aimy can help with
- ✅ `daily_plan`: Realistic timeline based on your emails
- ✅ `reasoning`: Actual AI analysis (not an error message)

## 🎯 Why This Works

**Before**: You authenticated via Vercel → credentials in Redis
**After**: You authenticate via Railway → credentials in PostgreSQL

The standup endpoint queries PostgreSQL, so it needs Railway auth.

## 📝 If It Still Doesn't Work

Report back with:
1. The full console logs
2. The `reasoning` text from the standup response
3. Any error messages

We'll debug further if needed!
