# OpAlly Logo Setup

## Action Required: Add Logo File

Please save the OpAlly logo image as:
`/workspaces/codespaces-react/floally-mvp/frontend/public/opally-logo.png`

### Steps:
1. Download the OpAlly logo image from the conversation
2. Save it to this directory as `opally-logo.png`
3. The logo should be in PNG format with a transparent background
4. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or larger for quality

### Current References:
The following files now reference the logo:
- `frontend/index.html` - Favicon
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Login screen logo
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Dashboard header logo

Once the logo file is added, the app will display it correctly!
