# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Fix Production Issues

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED

---

## 🔴 Current Issues

1. **"[User]" appears in greeting** instead of your name
2. **"Analyze Emails" hangs indefinitely**
3. **"Help Aime Learn" buttons all fail**

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

Your Vercel frontend is trying to connect to `localhost:8000` instead of the Railway backend.

**Why?** Vercel doesn't have the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable set.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable in Vercel

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/[your-username]/floally-mvp-d548/settings/environment-variables**

2. Click **"Add New"**

3. Enter:
   - **Name:** `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app`
   - **Environments:** ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development

4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Redeploy

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/[your-username]/floally-mvp-d548/deployments**

2. Find the latest deployment

3. Click the **"..."** menu (three dots)

4. Click **"Redeploy"**

5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Test

1. Hard refresh your site: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac)

2. Open browser DevTools Console (F12)

3. You should see: `API URL: https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app`

4. Test features:
   - ✅ Click "Generate Stand-Up" - should work
   - ✅ Click "Analyze Emails" - should work
   - ✅ Click "Help Aime Learn" on any email - should work

### Step 4: Fix "[User]" in Greeting

1. Click the **"👤 Profile"** button or complete onboarding

2. **Step 1 of 6:** Enter your name (e.g., "Alex", "Sam", etc.)

3. Complete all 6 steps

4. Your name will now appear: **"Good morning, [Your Name] 🌞"**

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

### Before Fix:
- Console shows: `API URL: http://localhost:8000`
- Network tab shows failed requests to localhost
- Greeting shows: "Good morning 🌞" (no name)

### After Fix:
- Console shows: `API URL: https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app`
- Network tab shows successful requests to Railway
- After onboarding: "Good morning, [Your Name] 🌞"

## 📝 Technical Details

### What We Created:

1. **`frontend/.env`** (local development)
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app
   ```

2. **`frontend/.env.production`** (build-time)
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app
   ```

3. **`VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide

### What You Need to Do:

⚠️ **Set the environment variable in Vercel dashboard** (Vercel doesn't read `.env` files from the repo)

---

## 🛠️ Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

If you have Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
cd floally-mvp/frontend

# Add environment variable
vercel env add VITE_API_URL
# Enter: https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app
# Select: Production, Preview, Development (all)

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "[User]"?
- This is normal until you complete onboarding
- The AI uses "[User]" as a placeholder when it doesn't know your name
- Complete Step 1 of onboarding to set your display name

### API calls still failing?
1. Check browser console for `API URL:` message
2. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
3. Check Network tab - requests should go to `floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app`
4. Verify Railway backend is up: 
   ```bash
   curl https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/status
   ```

### Environment variable not working?
1. Double-check spelling: `VITE_API_URL` (case-sensitive!)
2. Make sure you clicked "Save" in Vercel
3. Make sure you redeployed after adding the variable
4. Variables only apply to NEW deployments, not existing ones
