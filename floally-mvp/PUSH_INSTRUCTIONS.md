# Push Instructions

## Current Status
All changes are committed locally in the Codespace, but need to be pushed from your local machine due to permission constraints.

## Commits Ready to Push
There are **6 commits** in your Codespace that need to be pushed to GitHub:

1. **94c1a68** - "Try Claude 3 Opus - Sonnet may not be enabled on this account"
2. **0bfe877** - "Use MODEL_NAME env var for Claude model selection"  
3. **315566d** - "Update session log with complete OpAlly MVP progress - all features working!"
4. **1220781** - "Add push instructions for syncing Codespace commits"
5. **1f55856** - "Improve UX: AI Stand-Up at top, expandable emails, calendar date labels"
6. **5568964** - "Document UX improvements and design decisions"

## How to Push from Local Machine

From your local computer's terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/floally-mvp

# Pull the latest changes from Codespace
git pull origin main

# Push everything to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## What This Will Do
- Sync the Codespace commits to GitHub
- Trigger Vercel to deploy the new UX improvements (AI Stand-Up at top, expandable emails, calendar dates)
- Update documentation for future reference

## Priority
**HIGH** - The UX improvements significantly enhance the daily user experience:
- AI Stand-Up is now the first thing users see (primary value prop)
- Emails are now readable and actionable within OpAlly
- Calendar shows actual dates (Today/Tomorrow/specific days)
