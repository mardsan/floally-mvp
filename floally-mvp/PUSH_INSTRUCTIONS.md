# Push Instructions

## Current Status
All changes are committed locally in the Codespace, but need to be pushed from your local machine due to permission constraints.

## Commits Ready to Push
There are **3 commits** in your Codespace that need to be pushed to GitHub:

1. **94c1a68** - "Try Claude 3 Opus - Sonnet may not be enabled on this account"
2. **0bfe877** - "Use MODEL_NAME env var for Claude model selection"  
3. **315566d** - "Update session log with complete OpAlly MVP progress - all features working!"

## How to Push from Local Machine

From your local computer's terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/floally-mvp

# Pull the latest changes from Codespace
git pull origin main

# Push everything to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## What This Will Do
- Sync the Codespace commits to GitHub
- Trigger Railway to deploy (though the working code is already deployed from GitHub web editor)
- Update the session log documentation for future reference

## Note
The production app is already working! These commits are mainly for:
- Documentation (SESSION_LOG.md updates)
- Code organization (env var support)
- Version history completeness

The critical fix (Claude 3 Haiku model) was already deployed via GitHub web editor earlier, so the app is fully functional.
