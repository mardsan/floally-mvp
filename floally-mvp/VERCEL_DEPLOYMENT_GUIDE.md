## üîß If Deployment Doesn't Start

### Manual Trigger via GitHub:
The push we just did should trigger it, but if not:

```bash
# Make a trivial change to trigger redeploy
cd /workspaces/codespaces-react/floally-mvp/frontend
echo "# Deployment trigger $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger Vercel redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Manual Deploy via Vercel CLI:
If you want to deploy directly (requires login):

```bash
cd /workspaces/codespaces-react/floally-mvp/frontend

# Login to Vercel (opens browser)
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

---

## üîç Verifying the Deployment

### Check Deployment ID:
Once deployed, check the browser console on https://floally-mvp.vercel.app

Look for:
```
OkAimy App loaded - Version 1.3.0 - Built: ...
```

### Check API Connection:
The frontend should connect to:
```
https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app
```

Verify in browser DevTools > Network tab when you login or generate stand-up.

## üìä Backend Status

Your backend is deployed separately on Railway:
- **URL:** https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app
- **Health Check:** https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/health

The backend ALSO needs the rebranding deployed. Let's check if Railway auto-deploys from GitHub:

### Deploy Backend to Railway:

**Option 1: Auto-deploy (if configured)**
- Railway may auto-deploy when you push to main
- Check Railway dashboard: https://railway.app

**Option 2: Manual trigger**
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Find your "floally-mvp" service
- Click "Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)
Check Vercel dashboard or wait for webhook notification

### 2. Test the Site

### 4. Check Railway Backend:
