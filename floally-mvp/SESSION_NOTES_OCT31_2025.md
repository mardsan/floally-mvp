---

## üéØ Major Features Completed

### 1. Status Persistence & Standup Caching ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved:**
- Standup priorities were regenerating on every page refresh
- Status didn't persist across page reloads
- Each task needed independent status tracking

**Implementation:**
- **Backend:** Created `standup_status` table with full context storage
- **API Endpoints:** 
  - `GET /standup/today` - Returns cached standup analysis
  - `GET /standup/status?task_title=...` - Task-specific status
  - `POST /standup/status` - Save status with full context
  - `PUT /standup/status/{id}` - Quick status updates
- **Frontend:** Modified `MainDashboard.jsx` to check cache first, only run AI on explicit refresh
- **Data Flow:** Cache-first strategy prevents unnecessary AI calls and keeps priorities consistent

**Key Files Modified:**
```
backend/app/models/user.py (lines 177-210) - StandupStatus model
backend/app/routers/standup.py - Added 4 new endpoints
backend/migrate_add_standup_status.py - Database migration
frontend/src/components/MainDashboard.jsx - Caching logic, status management
```

**Bug Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Subtitle not updating when swapping tasks
2. ‚úÖ Status being date-specific instead of task-specific  
3. ‚úÖ Standup regenerating on every refresh (needed caching)
4. ‚úÖ Secondary priorities not loading from cache
5. ‚úÖ Secondary priorities showing no titles (field name mismatch)
6. ‚úÖ Urgency score mismatch between scale display and details
7. ‚úÖ Removed confusing urgency scales from Other Priorities (simplified UX)

**Start Working Button:**
- Sets status to "In Progress" automatically
- Expands "Details from Aimy" to show full context
- One-click workflow to begin working on priority task

---

### 2. Projects Management Page with AI Wizard ‚úÖ

**What We Built:**
Full-featured projects management system with AI-powered planning assistance.

**Features:**
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, Delete projects
- **View Modes:** Grid cards or compact list view
- **Search & Filter:** By project name, description, status
- **Status Management:** Active, On Hold, Completed, Archived
- **Priority Badges:** Critical, High, Medium, Low with color coding
- **Project Colors:** Custom color bar for visual organization

**AI-Powered Creation (AimyWizard):**
Instead of manual form filling, users can:
1. Give brief project description (e.g., "Website redesign")
2. Click "‚ú® Let Aimy Plan It"
3. AI generates complete project plan:
   - Enhanced description (2-3 detailed sentences)
   - Realistic timeline (e.g., "2-3 weeks")
   - 3-5 SMART goals with **actual calendar dates** (not "Week 1")
   - Success metrics
   - Recommended priority level
4. Review and edit AI suggestions before saving
5. Goals stored with project for tracking

**Backend Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/ai/generate-project-plan
- Uses Claude 3 Haiku (cost-effective)
- Structured JSON response
- Considers current date for realistic deadlines
```

**Key Files:**
```
frontend/src/components/ProjectsPage.jsx - Main projects UI with wizard integration
frontend/src/components/AimyWizard.jsx - AI project planning wizard
frontend/src/App.jsx - Added /projects routing
backend/app/routers/ai.py (lines 284-384) - AI project generation endpoint
backend/app/routers/projects.py - CRUD endpoints (already existed)
```

**Navigation:**
- Changed dashboard header button from "+ New Project" to "üìÅ Projects"
- Navigates to `/projects` route
- Full project management interface

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Urgency Score Consistency Issue

**Problem:** 
Urgency scale showed different numbers than "Details from Aimy" for the same task.

**Root Cause:**
- Old cached data had `confidence: 0.8` (0-1 scale)
- New AI data had `urgency: 80` (0-100 scale)  
- Frontend had mixed conversion logic
- task_details map built from one source, display from another

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Standardized urgency handling in buildStandupState()
const urgency = priority.urgency || 
                (priority.confidence ? Math.round(priority.confidence * 100) : 50);

// When saving, convert back to urgency format
secondary_priorities: decisions.map(d => ({
  title: d.decision,
  urgency: Math.round((d.confidence || 0.5) * 100),
  action: d.action
}))
```

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/MainDashboard.jsx` - Unified urgency/confidence handling

---

## üìÅ Database Changes

### New Table: `standup_status`

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE standup_status (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  task_title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  task_description TEXT,
  task_project VARCHAR(100),
  urgency INTEGER,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'not_started',
  started_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  ai_reasoning TEXT,
  secondary_priorities JSONB,
  daily_plan JSONB,
  date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_standup_status_user_date ON standup_status(user_id, date);
CREATE INDEX idx_standup_status_task ON standup_status(user_id, task_title, date);
```

**Migration Status:** ‚úÖ Completed in Railway PostgreSQL

## üîß Technical Decisions

### Caching Strategy
- **Cache-first approach:** Check database before running AI
- **Explicit refresh:** Only regenerate on button click (forceRefresh=true)
- **Daily scope:** Cache expires at midnight (same date only)
- **Full context storage:** Save secondary_priorities and daily_plan for complete restoration

### Data Format Standardization
- **Backend:** Always send `urgency` (0-100 scale)
- **Frontend:** Convert to `confidence` (0-1) for internal use
- **Display:** Convert back to 0-100 for user-facing scores
- **Storage:** Save as urgency (0-100) for consistency

### UX Simplifications
- Removed urgency scales from "Other Priorities" list
- Keep urgency info in "Details from Aimy" only
- Reduces visual clutter and confusion
- Focus on task names and quick actions

---

## üìã Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (High Value, Quick Wins)
1. **Test AI Project Creation** (30 min)
   - Create project with Aimy wizard
   - Verify goals generation with actual dates
   - Check priority recommendation
   - Test manual skip option

2. **Trusted Contacts Management UI** (3-4 hours)
   - Backend already complete
   - Build ProfileHub tab component
   - View/edit/delete trusted/blocked senders
   - Show trust levels and statistics
   - Search and filter capabilities

### Medium Priority
3. **UI Refresh with Tailwind Template** (8-12 hours)
   - Evaluate Tailkits templates
   - Create component migration plan
   - Incremental replacement for professional polish
   - Defer until core features stable

4. **Multi-source Calendar Integration** (6-8 hours)
   - Add Outlook calendar support
   - Add Slack calendar events
   - Unified event fetching service
   - Currently only Google Calendar works

### Low Priority (Technical Debt)
5. **Unify OAuth Storage** (4-6 hours)
   - App has dual OAuth: Vercel (Redis) + Railway (PostgreSQL)
   - Choose one approach and consolidate
   - Both work but creates maintenance overhead

## üí° Key Learnings

### Status Persistence
- Task-specific status requires granular storage (not just date-based)
- Caching prevents AI cost explosion
- Need consistent data structures between save and load paths

### AI Integration
- Users prefer AI assistance to manual form filling
- Brief prompt ‚Üí complete plan is more valuable than empty form
- Actual dates (2025-11-15) better than relative ("Week 1")
- Show AI suggestions but allow editing before commit

### UX Clarity
- Progress bars have strong mental model as "completion" not "urgency"
- When everything is "high priority", need numeric scores to differentiate
- Simpler is better - removed scales from list, kept in details

---

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, deployed on Vercel
- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy, deployed on Railway
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Railway
- **AI:** Claude 3 Haiku via Anthropic API

## üîç Debugging Tips

### If Standup Not Caching
1. Check `/api/standup/today` returns `has_standup: true`
2. Verify standup_status table has records for today
3. Check console for "‚úÖ Using cached standup" log
4. Database query looks for same date (not datetime)

### If Urgency Scores Mismatch
1. Check backend sends `urgency` (0-100) not `confidence` (0-1)
2. Verify conversion: `confidence = urgency / 100`
3. Check task_details map has correct urgency value
4. Look at "Details from Aimy" for actual stored urgency

### If Projects AI Fails
1. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set in Railway
2. Check `/api/ai/generate-project-plan` endpoint
3. Fallback plan should still work (basic 4-week template)
4. Console will show "Error generating project plan"
