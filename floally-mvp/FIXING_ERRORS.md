## üîß ERROR 2: "Analyze Emails" Does Nothing

2. **Open your backend project**
3. **Click "Variables" tab**
4. **Check if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exists:**
   - ‚úÖ If it exists ‚Üí Make sure it's a valid Claude API key
   - ‚ùå If it doesn't exist ‚Üí Add it now

5. **To Add/Update:**
   - Click "New Variable"
   - **Name:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `sk-ant-api03-...` (your Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Click "Add"

6. **Railway will auto-redeploy** (wait 2-3 minutes)

## üêõ Common Issues

### **422 Error Still Appears:**
- Railway hasn't redeployed yet (wait 3-5 minutes)
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check Railway deployment status

### **Analyze Emails Still Hangs:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set in Railway
- API key invalid or expired
- Check Railway logs for "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured" error

### **Other API Calls Fail:**
- Check `VITE_API_URL` is set in Vercel
- Verify Railway backend is running: `curl https://floally-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
- Check CORS settings (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Railway)
